# PyCocks

This is a Python implementation of Cocks' identity-based encryption (IBE) scheme.

# Usage

The module comprises two classes:

1. ```CocksPKG```: the public key generator (PKG) responsible for the scheme's initialisation and extracting secret keys from authorised user identity values.

2. ```Cocks```: the user-side class for encrypting and decrypting messages using the secret key and modulus generated by ```CocksPKG```.

Example usage:
```
from cocks.cocks import CocksPKG, Cocks

cocks_pkg = CocksPKG()   # Optional param.: bit size (default = 2048)

# Extract private key, r, from an identity string; a transformed
# ID string, a, is also returned, which is required for encryption
# and decryption.
r, a = cocks_pkg.extract("User1")

cocks = Cocks(cocks_pkg.n)  # Must use same public modulus, n, from cocks_pkg
c = cocks.encrypt(b"test", a)
msg = cocks.decrypt(c, r, a)  # => b"test"
```


# Requirements

gmpy2 (tested v2.0.8)
